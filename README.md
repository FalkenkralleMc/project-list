# Project List

Do you know that feeling when you get super hyped about a new idea – only to abandon it a few days later?  
That happens to me all the time. So I (ironically 😅) started a new project: **a list to store and keep track of all my started and planned projects.**

## ⚠️Disclaimer
This project is a **side project**, so it may be paused, abandoned, or put on hold at any time.  
It’s a **work in progress 🚧** – I’ll remove this note once I feel it’s “finished.”  

I’m mainly building it for myself, but maybe it can also be useful for someone else – so I decided to push it here 😅.  
If it goes well, I’ll deploy it on Netlify so you don’t have to bother with cloning and running it locally.
